# Privacy Policy

Last updated: September 2025

Thank you for using **Worklog**. This Privacy Policy explains what information the app collects, how it is used, and your choices.

## Information We Collect

- **Crash & Diagnostics Data:** We collect basic app diagnostics and crash reports through [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/products/crashlytics). This helps us improve stability and fix bugs.
- **Purchase Information:** If you buy Pro features, the app uses [Google Play Billing](https://play.google.com/about/play-terms/) to process the transaction. We do not see or store your payment details â€” only the purchase status (e.g., active, expired) is checked.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

We do not collect personal details such as your name, email, location, contacts, photos, or files. All shift/work data you enter stays only on your device unless you manually export it.

## How We Use Data

- To keep the app stable and fix crashes.
- To confirm and restore purchases you have made.
- To provide Pro features after purchase.

## Data Sharing

We share limited technical data with:

- **Google Firebase:** crash reports and diagnostics.
- **Google Play Billing:** purchase status to unlock Pro features.

## Your Choices

- You can request deletion of your data by contacting us (see below).
- You can choose not to upgrade to Pro; the app will still work with free features.
